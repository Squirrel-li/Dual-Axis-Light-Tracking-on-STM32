# Dual-Axis Light Tracking System Based on STM32

## Project Overview

This project implements a dual-axis light tracking system using the STM3210E EVAL board with an STM32F103ZG microcontroller. The system leverages two SG90 servo motors for directional control and five photoresistors for light detection. The goal is to dynamically align the system with the brightest light source in its environment, demonstrating real-time light tracking capabilities.
